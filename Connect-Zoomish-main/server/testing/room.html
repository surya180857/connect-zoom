<!--
🎯 FILE PURPOSE: Simple test page for bots - minimal interface for automated testing
📍 LOCATION: room.html - Root directory, served at http://localhost:3001/room.html
🔗 DEPENDENCIES: None (pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
📤 EXPORTS: Basic HTML page with join/leave/speak buttons
📥 IMPORTS: None (self-contained)
🎮 USAGE: Used by bots for testing, not for real users
🐛 COMMON ISSUES: None (very simple, no complex functionality)
👤 BEGINNER NOTES: This is like a "training room" for bots to practice

📖 WHAT THIS FILE DOES:
1. Provides a simple HTML interface with 3 buttons
2. Logs button clicks to screen and browser console
3. Used by automation bots for testing basic functionality
4. No actual video/audio - just simulates user interactions

🔍 KEY CONCEPTS FOR BEGINNERS:
- Legacy Code: Old code kept for compatibility/testing
- Stub Functions: Functions that pretend to do something (for testing)
- Bot Testing: Automated programs testing the interface
- Event Handlers: JavaScript code that runs when buttons are clicked

  <h2>AIRA Legacy Room</h2>
  <!-- 
  📝 BEGINNER EXPLANATION: 
  This page is kept for bot testing. It's much simpler than the main React app
  but provides basic buttons that bots can click to test their functionality.
  -->
  <p>room.html kept for bot testing.</p>
  <div>
    <!-- 🎯 TEST BUTTONS: Simple interface for bots to interact with -->
    <button id="join">Join</button>     <!-- Simulates joining a room -->
    <button id="leave">Leave</button>   <!-- Simulates leaving a room -->
    <button id="speakBtn">Speak</button> <!-- Simulates speaking/audio test -->
  </div>
  
  <!-- 📝 LOG AREA: Shows what happened when buttons are clicked -->
  <div id="log"></div>
  
  <script>
    // 📋 LOGGING FUNCTION: Writes messages to both screen and browser console
    // BEGINNER: This helps developers see what's happening during tests
    const log = (...a) => { 
      document.getElementById('log').textContent += a.join(' ') + "\n"; 
      console.log(...a); 
    };
    
    // 🎮 BUTTON EVENT HANDLERS: What happens when buttons are clicked
    // BEGINNER: These are "stub" functions - they just log messages instead of doing real work
    document.getElementById('join').onclick = () => log('joined (legacy stub)');
    document.getElementById('leave').onclick = () => log('left (legacy stub)');
    document.getElementById('speakBtn').onclick = () => log('speak (legacy stub)');
  </script>
